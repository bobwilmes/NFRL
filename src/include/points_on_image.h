/**
 * For each manual registration using two (2) pairs of corresponding control
 * points *across* images, each image *itself* "contains" two control points:
 * the "points on image" pair.
 *
 * There are two issues of interest:
 * 1. the length of the segment (in pixels)
 * 2. the angle of the segment with respect to the horizontal.
 * 
 * The segment length is used to calculate the "scale factor" for the sample
 * rate of the image where the scale factor is the ratio of two line-segment
 * lengths.  In theory, the basis segment for the ratio is that taken from
 * a device that is known to capture images at 500 pixels per inch (500PPI).
 * 
 * The angle is used to calculate the amount of rigid rotation required to
 * register two images.
